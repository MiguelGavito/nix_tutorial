# Development Roadmap

This document outlines the long-term vision for the Nix Tutorial. Read this to understand where the project is heading.

## Current Phase: Foundations
**Status:** In Progress  
**Goal:** Build core shell.nix tutorials with practical examples teams can use immediately

### Phase 1: Basic Tutorials with shell.nix (Current)
- ✅ nix-shell fundamentals
- ✅ Python development environment
- ✅ Node.js development environment
- ✅ Full-stack (Python + Node) example
- ✅ Quick package testing
- ⏳ Platform-specific guides (Linux, macOS, WSL)

### Phase 2: Advanced Topics (Next)
- Flakes introduction and migration
- Home Manager for team dotfiles
- NixOS introduction
- Development environment sharing

### Phase 3: Extended Coverage
- Database environments (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc)
- Docker integration with Nix
- CI/CD integration
- Performance optimization
- Troubleshooting guide

### Phase 4: Team Integration
- Best practices for team adoption
- Integration with existing projects
- Migration guide from traditional setup

## Design Principles

1. **Learn by Doing** - Every tutorial includes working code to run immediately
2. **Copy-Paste Ready** - Examples should be usable without modification
3. **Gradual Complexity** - Start simple, build up
4. **Team Focused** - Examples use real tech stacks (Python, Node, databases)
5. **Platform Inclusive** - Works on Linux, macOS, WSL, and NixOS

## Notes for Contributors

- Keep tutorials short (10-15 min completion time)
- Include expected output in examples
- Link to official docs for deeper learning
- Update for 2026 Nix ecosystem changes
- Gather feedback from team usage
